          <h2>Missile Man Of India</h2>
          <p>
            In the heart of India, there dwelled a man of dreams, A visionary, a
            scientist, by many esteemed. With eyes that mirrored the stars, and
            a heart pure and grand, He became the Missile Man, the nation's
            guiding hand. Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, his name etched in gold, A story
            of resilience, of brilliance, we're told. Born in a humble abode,
            with dreams in his eyes, He reached for the galaxies, touching the
            skies. In the realm of science, he found his sacred quest, To
            harness the atom, to become the very best. Aghast by the horrors of
            destructive force, He sought peaceful uses, a different course. With
            Agni, Prithvi, Trishul, and more, He made India's defense truly
            galore. But his missiles were not just steel and fire, They were the
            wings of hope, reaching higher and higher. He soared like a phoenix,
            from Rameswaram's shore, To Rashtrapati Bhavan, the nation to adore.
            Yet, in his rise, he remained grounded and true, A people's
            president, for me and for you. Through his words and wisdom, he
            kindled the spark, In every young heart, in light and in dark. He
            taught us to dream, to never give in, To conquer the world, and let
            aspirations begin. The Missile Man of India, a true guiding light,
            His legacy shines on, both day and night. In our hearts, in our
            dreams, he'll forever reside, Dr. Kalam, our hero, our nation's
            pride.
